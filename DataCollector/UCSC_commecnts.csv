&gt;Perhaps you’re thinking of the residents of Gaza (from which Israel withdrew in 2005) or the Palestinian residents of the West Bank. They’re not Israeli citizens, since they don’t live in Israel.

To my understanding Israel controls everything that comes  in and out of these places. Military dominance around Gaza and in the West Bank.

Also yes correction, Palestinians who are citizens of the Israeli government are by enlarge not restricted (although face huge amounts of discrimination). It is Gaza, West Bank, and East Jerusalem (for which they have 3 separate IDs for all 3 with different travel restrictions) that face the apartheid state whose water, electricity, housing, airspace are all controlled by Israel and the IDF. These people are natives of the land it is the state of Israel that has fractured, divided, and made refugees out of the Palestinians. 

No Israel should not annex the West Bank, furthermore there shouldn't be more settlers moving into the West Bank.

But, here's the thing, my opinion does not matter when it comes to learning historical accurate information. 

I'm not looking to give you my opinion on the conflict or how it should be solved -- I am asking you to learn the historic information before you put yourself into a discussion, and you cannot do that with youtube. (To answer your question *""without telling us what your problem with the information is all this does is nothing""* \-- the youtube video(s) you posted all have incorrect information to some degree, or lack the historical knowledge needed to understand what's going on (again, if you do NOT understand the infada(s) -- you will NOT understand why some Isrealis are saying comments like that in one of the videos you posted. Again, my problem is w/ genZ getting their I/P info from incorrect ""media"" sources.)

*""But telling me to read more books, and fly to the Middle East to do first hand interviews really doesn’t help.""*

You don't need to fly to the ""middle east"". There's plenty of Jewish, Israeli, and Palestinian individuals living and studying in the USA, even right here in the Bay Area. There's plenty of lectures and talks going on in the USA, and in the Bay Area where you can talk to people who live in the land and have skin in the game. And yes, genZ does need to read more books and journal articles from people who are involved in the conflict. Please stop linking YT videos like they are reputable media. The lack of reading w/ genZ is concerning imo. YT and western media are not reputable sources when it comes to I/P conflict.

Also, in your original comment you linked 3 ""news"" source, one is a western media source from Trevor Noah -- who does not have any formal journalist training or background. The other one is a latin america socialist news media -- you need to understand Latin America's implication in antisemitism, you need to understand ""crypto-jews"" too (see [https://www.ajc.org/news/podcast/antisemitism-in-latin-america-the-lasting-impact-of-the-amia-attack](https://www.ajc.org/news/podcast/antisemitism-in-latin-america-the-lasting-impact-of-the-amia-attack) and [https://www.ajc.org/news/the-state-of-antisemitism-in-latin-america](https://www.ajc.org/news/the-state-of-antisemitism-in-latin-america) [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/the-history-of-jews-in-latin-america](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/the-history-of-jews-in-latin-america) and [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/crypto-jews](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/crypto-jews) ) before using Latin America news media as your I/P source. And the 3rd is just some random youtuber. None of these videos are helpful or useful, and most are just spewing incorrect information. 

*""Also a similar parallel to the “you should actually go and talk to the people there” argument is when people say that they’ve been to Xin Jiang and there is no concentration camps then say “have you personally seen it yourself?” Like no I haven’t, but I trust the news sources over you.""*

The concentration camps and CCP are different than what is going on in the I/P conflict. Also, the CCP govt is **very** different than the democratic gov't of Israel. You can speak your mind in Israel. Idk what this has to do w/ learning historical and factual information. 

tl;dr genZ needs to listen to people with skin in the game w/ the I/P conflict. genZ needs to stop using YT as their source info, and start reading books and journal articles by those who have formal, educational training in non-bias journalism. genZ needs to understand the Jewish community better, Jewish diaspora, and the full history of antisemitism. My opinion, on how the I/P conflict should be solved or corrected, is mute when it comes to historical information -- and it should not matter what my opinion is when I'm telling you to please rethink how your obtaining information. genZ needs to get the historical information correct before con'ting to approach this conflict, b/c a lot of you are doing more harm than good.",,,False,False,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'chemslug'}]",False,{},,,False,False,True,t3_zyt87i,,dark,True,/r/UCSC/comments/zyt87i/the_other_reason_for_ethan_millers_retirement/j2anysw/,public,False,chemslug,[],1672435464,r/UCSC,0,,,,1672435476,1672435477,2a76853681c1514e849095e6511a3c1c74735bbe,2022-12-30 21:24:24,

Agreed. We’d also have to include the [Hamas charter](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hamas.asp), which says:

“Our struggle against the ***Jews*** is very great and very serious. It needs all sincere efforts.” [emphasis added]

“The Islamic Resistance Movement believes that the land of Palestine is an Islamic Waqf consecrated for future Moslem generations until Judgement Day. It, or any part of it, should not be squandered: it, or any part of it, should not be given up.”

“There is no solution for the Palestinian question except through Jihad. Initiatives, proposals and international conferences are all a waste of time and vain endeavors.”

Remember, this is from the **founding document** of the group in control of Gaza. Exactly how would you deal with such a group?

Also, if you believe that Trevor Noah and the _Daily Show_ are unbiased, I have a bridge to sell you.

I’ll also note that **Muslim citizens (indeed, *all* citizens) of Israel have full equal rights**. Perhaps you’re thinking of the residents of Gaza (from which Israel withdrew in 2005) or the Palestinian residents of the West Bank. They’re not Israeli citizens, since they don’t live in Israel. Or are you saying that Israel should annex the West Bank? Residents of East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, both of which *were* annexed, were given the option to become Israeli citizens. There *is* discrimination in Israel, as in any other democratic country with a minority population — France, Germany, Sweden, UK, and, yes, US. It’s wrong, but it’s not *apartheid*.

I would not be happy should the US perform the same actions Israel has done against Palestinians. 

Furthermore to expand on the Mexicans in California analogy. California does not treat its Mexican citizens the same way Israel treats its Palestinian citizens.

The [IHRA definition of antisemitism](https://www.state.gov/defining-antisemitism/), which has been adopted by the US and the EU, states (in part) that antisemitism is:

-	Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor.
-	Applying double standards by requiring of it a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation.

By omitting the threat of 4000 rockets from Gaza, the UCSC departments remove the obvious rationale of “self-defense”, making the statements antisemitic.

&gt;Perhaps you’re thinking of the residents of Gaza (from which Israel withdrew in 2005) or the Palestinian residents of the West Bank. They’re not Israeli citizens, since they don’t live in Israel.

*""But telling me to read more books, and fly to the Middle East to do first hand interviews really doesn’t help.""*

You don't need to fly to the ""middle east"". There's plenty of Jewish, Israeli, and Palestinian individuals living and studying in the USA, even right here in the Bay Area. There's plenty of lectures and talks going on in the USA, and in the Bay Area where you can talk to people who live in the land and have skin in the game. And yes, genZ does need to read more books and journal articles from people who are involved in the conflict. Please stop linking YT videos like they are reputable media. The lack of reading w/ genZ is concerning imo. YT and western media are not reputable sources when it comes to I/P conflict. [https://psmag.com/ideas/theres-a-crisis-of-reading-among-generation-z](https://psmag.com/ideas/theres-a-crisis-of-reading-among-generation-z)

Also, in your original comment you linked 3 ""news"" source, one is a western media source from Trevor Noah -- who does not have any formal journalist training or background. The other one is a latin america socialist news media -- you need to understand Latin America's implication in antisemitism, you need to understand ""crypto-jews"" too (see [https://www.ajc.org/news/podcast/antisemitism-in-latin-america-the-lasting-impact-of-the-amia-attack](https://www.ajc.org/news/podcast/antisemitism-in-latin-america-the-lasting-impact-of-the-amia-attack) and [https://www.ajc.org/news/the-state-of-antisemitism-in-latin-america](https://www.ajc.org/news/the-state-of-antisemitism-in-latin-america) [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/the-history-of-jews-in-latin-america](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/the-history-of-jews-in-latin-america) and [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/crypto-jews](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/crypto-jews) ) before using Latin America news media as your I/P source. And the 3rd is just some random youtuber. None of these videos are helpful or useful, and most are just spewing incorrect information. 

*""Also a similar parallel to the “you should actually go and talk to the people there” argument is when people say that they’ve been to Xin Jiang and there is no concentration camps then say “have you personally seen it yourself?” Like no I haven’t, but I trust the news sources over you.""*

The concentration camps and CCP are different than what is going on in the I/P conflict. Also, the CCP govt is **very** different than the democratic gov't of Israel. You can speak your mind in Israel. Idk what this has to do w/ learning historical and factual information. 

tl;dr genZ needs to listen to people with skin in the game w/ the I/P conflict. genZ needs to stop using YT as their source info, and start reading books and journal articles by those who have formal, educational training in non-bias journalism. genZ needs to understand the Jewish community better, Jewish diaspora, and the full history of antisemitism. My opinion, on how the I/P conflict should be solved or corrected, is mute when it comes to historical information -- and it should not matter what my opinion is when I'm telling you to please rethink how your obtaining information. genZ needs to get the historical information correct before con'ting to approach this conflict, b/c a lot of you are doing more harm than good.",,,False,False,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'chemslug'}]",False,{},,,False,False,True,t3_zyt87i,,dark,True,/r/UCSC/comments/zyt87i/the_other_reason_for_ethan_millers_retirement/j2anysw/,public,False,chemslug,[],1672435464,r/UCSC,0,,,,1672435476,1672435477,2a76853681c1514e849095e6511a3c1c74735bbe,2022-12-30 21:24:24,

Agreed. We’d also have to include the [Hamas charter](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hamas.asp), which says:

“Our struggle against the ***Jews*** is very great and very serious. It needs all sincere efforts.” [emphasis added]

“The Islamic Resistance Movement believes that the land of Palestine is an Islamic Waqf consecrated for future Moslem generations until Judgement Day. It, or any part of it, should not be squandered: it, or any part of it, should not be given up.”

“There is no solution for the Palestinian question except through Jihad. Initiatives, proposals and international conferences are all a waste of time and vain endeavors.”

Remember, this is from the **founding document** of the group in control of Gaza. Exactly how would you deal with such a group?

Also, if you believe that Trevor Noah and the _Daily Show_ are unbiased, I have a bridge to sell you.

I’ll also note that **Muslim citizens (indeed, *all* citizens) of Israel have full equal rights**. Perhaps you’re thinking of the residents of Gaza (from which Israel withdrew in 2005) or the Palestinian residents of the West Bank. They’re not Israeli citizens, since they don’t live in Israel. Or are you saying that Israel should annex the West Bank? Residents of East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, both of which *were* annexed, were given the option to become Israeli citizens. There *is* discrimination in Israel, as in any other democratic country with a minority population — France, Germany, Sweden, UK, and, yes, US. It’s wrong, but it’s not *apartheid*.
